[Yemen Open Source](https://github.com/YemenOpenSource) is a developer's platform that aims to improve the collaboration between Yemeni developers, foster creative thinking, and give back to the community. The project hopes to create a thriving community for Yemeni developers through open-source projects and tech-related difficulties, such as supporting Arabic and RTL concerns, easing payment gateway integrations, etc. Also, it aims to Arabize tech knowledge as much as possible and highlight outstanding initiatives by Yemeni developers.
