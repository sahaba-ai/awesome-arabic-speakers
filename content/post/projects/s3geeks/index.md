[S3Geeks](https://s3geeks.com/) is a non-profit organization established in 2011 by a group of young Egyptians from Upper Egypt (south). It works on spreading technology and the internet, specifically in Upper Egypt and generally in Egypt and the Middle East. The organization aims to organize and mobilize the efforts of Egyptian youth to establish a new community for tech entrepreneurs to advance and develop Upper Egypt as an integral part of Egypt. Over the years, their efforts have achieved great success, attracting the support and sponsorship of global companies. Their activities have expanded to cover all the governorates and cities of Upper Egypt. Sa3eedy Geeks is now considered the first platform for entrepreneurs and tech enthusiasts in Upper Egypt.
